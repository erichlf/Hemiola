# About Hemiola

Hemiola aims to turn any n-key rollover keyboard into a chordable keyboard.
Instead of typing one letter at a time one would press multiple letters at
the same time and the letters would show as if you had typed the letters
in order. The only physical requirements are a usb keyboard and a
Rapberry Pi Zero. There are no dependency requirements on the OS side of
things.
